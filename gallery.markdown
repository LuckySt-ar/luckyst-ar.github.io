<h2><i><strong>Welcome to the realm of Forgotten Dreams.</strong></i></h2>

<p><i>Using AI and manual methods (repainting, animation), this collection is a reimagining and expansion of my original AI-only collection, 108 Dreams. Each piece represents a significant entity within the web3 space, destined to move things forward, for the greater good of all.</i></p> 

<p><i>My focus is on Accessibility and Inclusion. I want my work to reflect the times we are in, and hope for a brighter tomorrow. I want to make it so people can get quality art no matter what. I want my professional art friends I miss to see this and know they can do this and thrive in web3.  Thank you for taking your precious time to witness these collaborative works.</i></p>
